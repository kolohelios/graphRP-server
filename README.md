# graphRP Server


## Requirements

* Node.js (preferably v10 or higher)
* npm

## Getting Started

### Development

* clone down this repository
* run `npm i` in the project root
* run `npm run dev`

### Testing

* run `npm test`

### TODO

- [ ] decide whether to leave the --runInBand flag on for jest or to allow multiple instances of the server to start concurrently (tradeoff of time to run test suite vs memory consumption)
